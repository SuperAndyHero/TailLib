having frameskip off causes random weird offsets for a single frame
look into combining npc and player targets, may be possible to reuse a vanilla target?
forces on starry tail need to be redone
forces on shark tail need a major rewrite
add wireframe to the chain sim
look into having mod player check item slots for tail items instead of items doing it themselves (cleaner and faster)
add a config

Needed before release:
item icons
Very large fox tail
maybe implement vanilla tails

Done:
fix spine drawing
fix sprite drawing (mods that use it need to call a specific method)
make shaders draw on main menu
