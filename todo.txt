having frameskip off causes random weird offsets for a single frame
look into combining npc and player targets, may be possible to reuse a vanilla target?
forces on starry tail need to be redone
look into having mod player check item slots for tail items instead of items doing it themselves (cleaner and faster)

Needed before release:
item icons

Done:
fix spine drawing
fix sprite drawing (mods that use it need to call a specific method)
make shaders draw on main menu
