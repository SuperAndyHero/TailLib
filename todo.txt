look into combining npc and player targets, may be possible to reuse a vanilla target?
globalNPC's tail RemovalQueue should be an actual queue
forces on starry tail need to be redone
check one more time if chain.screenpos needs the extra offset
add more config options
find out where float percision error is coming from (precision is being lost, not gained)
having frameskip off causes random weird offsets for a single frame
check if disabler breaks in edge cases

Needed before release:

Library:
check if gravity breaks tails for other players/moving the camera
make sure rendering culling does not break anything
make sure sim culling does not break anything

Content:
forces on shark tail need a major rewrite
shark tail is a bit too low, or needs sprite change
Very large fox tail
maybe implement cat and alien tail from vanilla costumes (cant find frames)



Done:
pixelation
config option to force npc active state (debug only unless it is needed)
check if disabler breaks when enabling/disabling mid game
Item names
Check if npc disabler works
figure out how to only enable npc RT if a mod needs it (loading order issues? or use property when setting to true)
fix lizard tail
item icons (first pass)
have mod player check item slots for tail items instead of items doing it themselves (cleaner and faster)
add rendering/sim culling
add wireframe to the chain sim
reset on teleport
fix spine drawing
fix sprite drawing (mods that use it need to call a specific method)
make shaders draw on main menu
(?)FIX GRAVITY (use transformation matrix instead of zoom matrix, and implement cullmode none)

(?)list not cleared when player leaves
(?)npc tail screenlag when upsidedown (only vertically)


(?)tail screen lag for every player but client's player//try diff between localPlayer pos and old pos?
(?)cont: in TailPlayer add a check if player is LocalPlayer and shift the position, or other way around (to avoid extra layer)
