having frameskip off causes random weird offsets for a single frame
look into combining npc and player targets, may be possible to reuse a vanilla target?
forces on starry tail need to be redone
forces on shark tail need a major rewrite
add wireframe to the chain sim
look into having mod player check item slots for tail items instead of items doing it themselves (cleaner and faster)
add more config options
shark tail is a bit too low, or needs sprite change
find why binoculars causes offset based on camera speed (may effect other players in mp?)

Needed before release:
check if gravity breaks tails for other players/moving the camera
item icons
Very large fox tail
fix lizard tail: extend sprite, redo points
maybe implement cat and alien tail from vanilla costumes
FIX GRAVITY (use transformation matrix instead of zoom matrix, and implement cullmode none)

Done:
fix spine drawing
fix sprite drawing (mods that use it need to call a specific method)
make shaders draw on main menu
