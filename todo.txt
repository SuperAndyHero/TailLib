look into combining npc and player targets, may be possible to reuse a vanilla target?
globalNPC's tail RemovalQueue should be an actual queue
forces on starry tail need to be redone
check one more time if chain.screenpos needs the extra offset
add more config options
having frameskip off causes random weird offsets for a single frame
not having window selected breaks rendering with dyes
zoom is delayed but this cannot be seen, may be a clue to other issues?

find out where float percision error is coming from (precision is being lost, not gained)
has to do with passed in pos, in a tail's DrawSprites drawing to a part of the screen has no jitter
but using (Main.LocalPlayer.position - Main.screenPosition) DOES have jitter (does not use chain pos at all, so cant be screen lag correction)
using only player.position does not have jitter
no jitten when moving camera with binoculars
jitter from the camera being moved before the player has moved? or the other way around?
TODO: check source and try other render hook positions (vanity mod has starry tail modified to be a jitter detector)
jitter effects Y pos too
solution(?) player pos more precice than screen pos???
jitter fixed (for base at least)
todo: try and offset drawing by precision error and see if it all can be fixed
remove debug code from tail player and tail system

Needed before release:

Library:
 Implement:
	PixelFilter needs to zoom pixels towards the center of the screen, like the camera does
	use AppliesToEntity in globalnpc to to save performance
 Check:
	check if npc disabler breaks in edge cases
	check if gravity breaks tails for other players/moving the camera
	make sure rendering culling does not break anything
	make sure sim culling does not break anything

Content:
 Implement:
	Recipes
	forces on shark tail need a major rewrite
	shark tail is a bit too low, or needs sprite change
	Very large fox tail
	maybe implement cat and alien tail from vanilla costumes (cant find frames)



Done:
otter tail is slightly offset wrong
lang names
add rigidness slider
pixelation
config option to force npc active state (debug only unless it is needed)
check if disabler breaks when enabling/disabling mid game
Item names
Check if npc disabler works
figure out how to only enable npc RT if a mod needs it (loading order issues? or use property when setting to true)
fix lizard tail
item icons (first pass)
have mod player check item slots for tail items instead of items doing it themselves (cleaner and faster)
add rendering/sim culling
add wireframe to the chain sim
reset on teleport
fix spine drawing
fix sprite drawing (mods that use it need to call a specific method)
make shaders draw on main menu
(?)FIX GRAVITY (use transformation matrix instead of zoom matrix, and implement cullmode none)

(?)list not cleared when player leaves
(?)npc tail screenlag when upsidedown (only vertically)


(?)tail screen lag for every player but client's player//try diff between localPlayer pos and old pos?
(?)cont: in TailPlayer add a check if player is LocalPlayer and shift the position, or other way around (to avoid extra layer)
